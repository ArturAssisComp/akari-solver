# Modeling board:
The board will be modeled as a matrix (NxM) with either white cells and black cells 
    - White Cells:
        - With light:    WL
        - Without light: W
    - Black Cells:
        - With number:    B<number>
        - Without number: B

The board will be read from a file/string in the following format:

# Comment lines (ignored)
NxM\n
cell00     cell01     cell02 ...     cell0(M-1)\n
cell10     cell11     cell12 ...     cell1(M-1)\n
...           ...                        ...
cell(N-1)0 cell(N-1)1 cell(N-1)2 ... cell(N-1)(M-1)\n
<EOF>


OBS:
    > Each cellij will be in {WL, W, B<number>, B};
    > <number> is in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
    > White spaces are ignored;
    > The parser is not case sensitive;
